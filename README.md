# Tier Away
Tier Away is a simple, open source tier list creation tool. No accounts, no public data, no prep work, no hassle.

Have a tier list idea that's too niche, something you're creating just for yourself or a few friends? Tier Away is perfect.

# Getting Started
Creating a tier list couldn't be easier. Just head to the site, click the Plus button, and upload your images. 

After that, arrange them until you're satisfied, then download it by clicking Download.

# Supported Files
Tier Away supports multiple types of content. Images can be uploaded or pasted from the clipboard, and text can be written directly onto the tier list.

# Sharing Templates
Tier Away templates are exportable via the Download button. These templates contain the structure of the list as well as all images, in a sharable ZIP file.

Tier Away does not offer image or template hosting.

# Themes
Tier Away currently has 5 custom themes, including a Dark and Light mode. More themes are planned.
