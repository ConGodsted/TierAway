# Tier Away
Tier Away is a simple, open source tier list creation tool. No accounts, no public data, no prep work, no hassle.

# Creation Process
Creating a tier list couldn't be easier. Just head to the site, click the Plus button, and upload your images. After that, arrange them until you're satisfied.

# Active Development
